    <h3>Why donate?</h3>
    <p>
      Donating to HSBNE is a great way of giving back to community while getting rid of old equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're currently working on becoming a registered charity with DGR status, at which time donating
      to HSBNE will have tax benefits.
    </p>
    <h4>Certificates of Donation</h4>
    <p>
      If you're a business (or you ask nicely) we're happy to provide a signed certificate of donation
      for display in your workplace.
    </p>

    <h3>What should I donate?</h3>
    <p>
      We love all sorts of donations, but especially things like these:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Old workshop equipment of any kind</li>
      <li>Electronic components</li>
      <li>Anything that has a motor in it, printers are typically good.</li>
      <li>Office fitout equipment, like boilers, soap dispensers, whiteboards, chairs etc</li>
      <li>Computers or computer parts, monitors/desktops/keyboards/mice</li>
      <li>Unused building materials</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What can't HSBNE accept?</h3>
    <p>
      99% of the time, we accept donations offered. Very rarely, we have to turn down offers,
      because we simply have no use. Here are some ideas of such things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Old TV's</li>
      <li>CRT Monitors</li>
      <li>inkjet printers</li>
      <li>Especially obsolete electronics</li>
    </ul>
