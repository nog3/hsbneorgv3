        <div>
            <h4>The Green Room</h4>
            <p>
                Our clean building has a large common area devoted as a general workspace and hangout zone, and we call this the Green Room.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Hipster Lounge</h4>
            <p>The Hipster Lounge is our front entryway and is the first part of the space you'll see after coming through our big blue doors. It contains displays of things made at the space and is a great area to relax in.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Classroom</h4>
            <p>
                The classroom is configurable to allow members to teach anything and is available for external groups to book on request. It has a capacity of around 30 people.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Member Storage</h4>
            <p>
                We devote an entire, locked to non-members room for members to temporarily store their tools and projects in 55L tubs.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>The Boneyard</h4>
            <p>
                HSBNE accepts donations from businesses and our members quite regularly. We store these donations in a room known as the boneyard. If you're a member and you need to scavenge for a switch here or a motor there, the Boneyard is the place to look.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Craft Punk</h4>
            <p>Craft Punk is home to many crafts, from costuming all the way to sewing and even geekier things. It houses equipment for heat press transfer onto shirts, mugs and plates as well as screen printing gear. Additionally, it is the home for our retro-fitted vacuum former which is a repurposed industrial Vacuum Sealer.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Digital Fabrication</h4>
            <p>
                Our Digital Fabrication room houses several useful machines, from our retrofitted chinese Laser Cutters to an A0 plotter and several 3d Printers. Need to prototype something? This is the spot.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Woodworking</h4>
            <p>
                Our Woodworking area is rapidly shaping up to be one of the best equipped parts of the space. It is now located in a much larger room and is stocked with general woodworking gear like lathes, drill presses, table saws, thicknessers and planers.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Metalworking</h4>
            <p>
                Our best equipped room, metalworking holds 2 lathes, a manual mill, metal bandsaw, linisher, and welding equipment as well as an assortment of finishing tools like grinders and a linisher. Metalworking holds our 2 ton Gantry, block-and-tackle, and our full sized car grease trap. It also is home to our Giganto-Printer, a 5x3m poster printer being converted for a new hackerspace life.

            </ul>
            <p>
                Make your way onto the ICB Northbound, follow through onto Kingsford Smith Drive. Take a right at Remora Rd, and a left at the first roundabout, onto MacArthur Ave. Continue past the first (and only) left hand turn (Barcham St) and turn right into our driveway just past that.
            </p>

            <p>
                The best City Cat terminal to go to the Northshore Hamilton City Cat terminal. Once you arrive walk up the ramp and through the park, turn left and walk about 600m past the really TALL shed and car park and the space is the first driveway on your left. It's about 700m all up.

            <p>
                <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/MDaiB">Shortest most direct route. 7.9Km</a> This is the shortest quickest way there from the city, lots of traffic, pedestrians and 99% main roads. I would only ride this if you are happy riding on the road in mains road traffic conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/ojf2U">Safest cycling route. 10.1Km</a> This route takes you round the back of the city and mostly stays to bike paths or bike lanes, it is a bit hillier but there is a lot less traffic to deal with.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/NRszW">The scenic route. 15.3Km</a> This is a reasonably long and mostly flat ride, there are a few hills when you come round past the story bridge including one evilly steep one, but it's well worth doing. Wear plenty of sunscreen and bring water to drink as there's a few gaps with little cover and no water to be found.
