## Agenda

- Quorum Rule change

> Proposal that Quorum is defined as 25% of the mean number of members who have attended the last four meetings, plus the number of executive multiplied by two. If membership falls beneath this threshold (mathematically defined as 14 people) quorum is 50% of total membership and votes require a simple majority of total membership.

- Shared working spaces and cleanliness
- Purchase Proposal: Tig Pedal for $205.81
- Purchase Proposal: Black toner for large laser printer for $150.
- Purchase Proposal: 2mm ABS sheets for Vacuformer for $170
